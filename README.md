I am an engineer with a Master of Business Administration degree, graduate analytics/data science certificates, and certification in agile project management (PSPO). I have earned experience harnessing data, developing analytics and business intelligence solutions, delivering actionable insights, and solving business challenges in the financial, consulting, and retail industries.

I want to become a Senior Analyst (Sr Analyst) / Data Scientist. I aim to continue expanding my career and helping organizations maximize value and performance by extracting actionable insights and developing accurate machine learning (AI) models.
